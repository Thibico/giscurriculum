# Module 0 - Gentle Introduction to GIS concepts

**Author**: Ben Hur

## Pedagogical Introduction

This module serves as a gentle introduction to geographic concepts necessary for working with geographic information systems (GIS). By the end of this module, learners should understand the following concepts:

- map projections
- coordinate reference systems
- spatial data formats (e.g. vectors and rasters)
- parts and features of a GIS
- uses of a GIS
- examples of GIS and other geospatial applications

In addition, this module will also introduce some key concepts of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) applications.

## Required tools and resources

The required tools and resources for this module are:

- working computer
- internet connection

## Prerequisites

- basic knowledge of operating a computer

## Thematic introduction

Let’s start with an example:

You might have heard the phrase “All maps lie.” or you’ve seen a post on social media claiming that “The map of the world you’ve known all your life is wrong!”. Well, it’s not that maps are actively choosing to lie to you, it’s just that maps can never show you the whole truth. One such example is the relative sizes of countries.

The True Size Of ([https://thetruesize.com/](https://thetruesize.com/)) is a cool web mapping application that shows how the relative sizes of countries are distorted in one of the most common maps we use (one that uses the Mercator projection). It also shows some examples of spatial data types that we will learn more about in this module. Try to use the web application to compare the size of your country with others.

## Breakdown of the concepts

So why is this the case? As you will learn in this module, it’s difficult to represent the 3-dimensional shape of the earth on a flat sheet of paper. To do this, cartographers use what’s called a **map** **projection** to project the points on the earth’s three-dimensional surface to a flat surface. However, by doing so, **distortion** is introduced. This distortion can be on the shape, size, direction, and distances of objects on the map. All maps have at least one of these distortions. Because of this distortion, a map can never show the whole truth about the earth.

In the web app we used, the background map that doesn’t change size (the grayish one) is an example of **raster** **data**. Raster data are pixel-based representations of the world similar to photographs. Meanwhile, the shape of the countries that we can move around are examples of **vector** **data**. Vector data, unlike rasters, represent the world using discrete objects such as points, lines, and polygons.

## Main content

### Phase 1 title: Maps and Coordinates

When people think of the earth today, they usually picture a spherical mass of blue, green, white, and brown floating in space. This is why the traditional way to model the earth is through the use of globes.


However, even though the globe is able to capture most of the characteristics of the earth, it suffers from two main drawbacks:

- Globes are cumbersome and difficult to bring with you.
- Globes are only usable at small scales (e.g. finding locations of countries, the relative positions of cities, etc.). They are next to useless for activities that require large scales or fine details (e.g. city navigation).

This is where maps come in. Maps remedy these two drawbacks of globes by representing the earth as a flat surface. By doing so, maps become portable and suitable for a multitude of uses. Having said that, maps also introduce a drawback of their own. Through the process of converting a three-dimensional object (globe) into a two-dimensional one (map), distortions are introduced such that it is impossible for a map to perfectly capture the different characteristics of the earth (i.e. shapes, areas, directions).

#### **Map Projections**

A map projection is used to flatten the earth’s (or globe’s) surface into a plane in order to create a map. This transformation process introduces distortion.

![The earth as an orange](media/dalandan.png "The earth as an orange")

You can think of the Earth as an orange. If you peel the skin, you can lay it down flat but you can never make it perfectly flat. You will always encounter one of the following issues:

- **Shearing** - the lengthening of the skin (or surface) in one or more directions
- **Tearing** - the splitting or breaking apart of the skin (or surface)
- **Compressing** - the shortening or shrinking of the skin (or surface)

Because of these issues, every map contains distortion in one or more of the following characteristics:

- **Shape**
- **Area**
- **Distance**
- **Direction**

Map projections can preserve (no distortion) one or more characteristics but never all at the same time. Alternatively, they can have a compromise where the distortions are balanced and minimized for all characteristics. This is due to the nature of the characteristics themselves.

Major characteristics like **Shape** and **Area** are **mutually exclusive** and cannot be preserved simultaneously. Meanwhile, the minor characteristics, **Distance** and **Direction** **cannot be correct everywhere** on the map.

In choosing what map projection to use, it’s important that you consider the purpose of the map. For example, if you wish to perform area-based analyses, it’s best to use a map projection that preserves the area.

There are several classifications of map projections. The first one is based on the **characteristic/s they preserve**.

- **Conformal** or **Orthomorphic** map projections are those that preserve shape or angular conformity. These are commonly used for navigation or meteorological purposes. Shapes are preserved but areas are distorted. The larger the area, the greater the distortion.
- **Equal-area** or **Authalic** map projections are those that preserve the proportion or relative areas of the objects in the map. In this kind of map projection, the larger the area being mapped, the more precise it is.
- **Equidistant** map projections preserve the distance of lines originating from one or two points on the map or have proper scale along one or more lines.
- **Azimuthal** map projections preserve the direction from one or two points on the map. These are useful for mapping routes of aircrafts and seacrafts between ports.

A single map projection can preserve more than one characteristic (e.g. an Azimuthal Equidistant projection that preserves the direction and distances from one or two points on the map) but not all of them as shown in the table below.
