# **Module 8 - Vector processing and analysis**

**Author**: Codrina Ilie

## Pedagogical Introduction

This module is focused on a specific type of geographical data model: vector geodata.

By the end of this module, learners will have the basic understanding of the following concepts:

* vector data model
* metadata
* vector processing
* spatial data analysis
* geostatistics
* topology
* geoprocessing

and acquire the following skills:

* Checking geometric vector dataset quality using algorithms to check vector data topology and perform basic automatic corrections;
* Working with algorithms to identify errors in the attribute table;
* Vector data processing - running simple geoprocessing algorithms to answer potential requirements, such as how many public buildings are in my administrative region?
* Vector data processing - using geostatistics algorithms to fill in missing data. 


## Required tools and resources

* This module has been prepared using [QGIS version 3.16.1 - Hannover](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
* The datasets used for all exercises detailed in this module are listed below:
* [module8.gpkg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cWNFcGGI_undZiecot8DVkWigm1qw09Z/view?usp=sharing) which contains the following layers:
   * schools (point)
   * pofw (point)
   * road (line)
   * waterways (line)
   * buildings (polygon)
   * landuse (polygon)
   * lagos_admin_boundary (polygon)
* The coordinate reference system used is the Minna / Nigeria Mid Belt, EPSG 26392. As it is a projected coordinate system, it allows geometric calculations. 


## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of operating a computer
* A robust understanding of modules 0, 1 and 2 and 6 of this curriculum. Module 0 introduces the notion of vector data model that is at the core of this current section. Prior understanding of modules 1, 2 and 6 allows you to focus strictly on the new notions and QGIS functionalities introduced in this new section, without having to wonder how you could load a new layer into your project, or how to work with the attribute table of your dataset.  

As part of this module, you will learn how to efficiently work with vector geographical datasets so that you can extract new information. This includes a more in depth understanding of what vector data is, what quality standards it must comply so that it is truly useful, what are the most common operations done on vector data (geoprocessing, geostatistics). 




## Thematic introduction

Let’s start with an example: You have just landed for your city break in Lagos, Nigeria and you need to get from the airport to your hotel. You have no knowledge of where the airport is situated with respect to the city, nor where the hotel is, so the first thing you do is open a map to help you navigate through this new and excited city! You take your phone out, open a map app and you select the start point - the airport - and the end point - your hotel - then ask for the route, by foot, car or public transport. In a matter of seconds, the routing app offers you the best solution for you to get from point A to point B and it highlights it by drawing a distinct line following streets and alleys, as visible in figure 8.1.


![Getting from point A to B using Openstreetmap](media/fig81.png "Getting from point A to B using Openstreetmap")

Figure 8.1 - Getting from point A to B using Openstreetmap


## Breakdown of the concepts

This is a classic example of vector data use and it breaks down into several concepts that we will define below. 

The data used is spatial - it has a very well defined location on Earth, its attributes are also well identified. Thus, a point with longitude and latitude and the attribute name= Clark International Airport - represents the starting point A and a point with another pair of longitude and latitude and the attribute name= Hotel Boss represents the end point B. Streets are represented by lines composed of segments and vertices (represented by blue small circles in figure 8.2), with attributes such as name, direction, speed limitation etc. 

![Vector lines representing streets and the associated attribute table](media/fig82.png "Vector lines representing streets and the associated attribute table")

Figure 8.2 - Vector lines representing streets and the associated attribute table

Streets represent a network model that is basically a collection of topologically interconnected point and line features. The results of the algorithm that calculates the route from point A to point B - in our case from the airport to the hotel - are highly dependent on the quality of the vectors, both in geometry - topology rules are respected - and in attributes - if a road is unidirectional that must be indicated so the routing doesn’t lead you the wrong way. 		

### The vector data model

As presented in module 0, there are 2 data models used in a geographical information system - GIS: raster and vector. Geospatial data always includes a **spatial** component indicating the location or the spatial distribution of the phenomenon at hand and an **attribute** component that describes its properties. The choice between using the raster or the vector data model for a particular situation depends on the source of the data as well as its intended use. 

The vector data model is used to represent areas, lines and points (Figure 8.1). 


![vector data with attribute table](media/fig83.png "vector data with attribute table")

Figure 8.1 - vector data with attribute table


### Metadata

Metadata is most simply defined as data about data. It characterises, at different levels of detail, the dataset that it is associated to, including categories such as: who is the provider/owner of the dataset, what is the license, in what language are the attributes written, what was the coordinate system used, which geographical area it describes and what is the reference year, keywords, what are the known limitations, accuracy level, what was the original scope of the dataset and many more.

Metadata is paramount because a clear understanding of the data to be used in a specific analysis can make the difference between a correct or a biased decision. If one must identify where to place a new temporary hospital, but the road data is old and no longer reflects the reality on site, then any decision based on it will be inaccurate. 

Because of the importance of metadata, its categories (their definitions, name, what kind of information they can store etc.) follow well-defined and standardized structures. These metadata well-structured files can then be integrated in dedicated catalogues, allowing a user to search and find geographical data only by querying the characteristics she is interested in, without downloading and analysing the data herself. There are numerous metadata catalogues and, when standardised, they can be accessed through different functionalities within GIS software. An example of that will be presented in Module 9 QGIS Plugins. 

It must be said that metadata is not a specificity of geospatial resources, but it applies to any kind of data.


### Rational of vector processing

The power of GIS lies in its unique capacity of connecting geometric properties that define real objects and phenomena in our world and their attributes - either observed, measured or calculated - and allowing through specialised software to perform operations on their geometries, on their attributes or both in order to derive new valuable information. 

Although most oftenly, GIS is closely associated with maps that simply display geographical information, its functionalities go far beyond the creation of cartographic representations, be they dynamic or static. 

**Spatial data analysis** (synonyms: spatial analysis, geospatial analysis, geographical analysis, spatial interaction) is a general term referring to any technique designed to identify patterns, to detect anomalies and to test theories based on spatial data. An analysis is spatial if and only if the results are sensible to relocation of the objects analysed - simply put, **location matters**. As information technology evolved, scientists started applying various techniques from the literature of statistics, geometry, topology and other sciences to the analysis of geographic data to study patterns and phenomena on the Earth’s surface. 

**Geostatistics** is a branch of statistics that applies to spatial data. The most common employed methods are related to interpolation, which is a mathematical process that allows  estimation of unknown values based on the known ones. 

**Topology** is a branch of mathematics that allows the GIS user to control the geometric relationships between features and maintain geometric integrity. Topology is best understood as a set of rules that ensures spatial data quality that can apply to the same vector layer or more. The rules are designed as to respect the real world relationships that the vector layers represent. For example there can be no gaps between the polygons that represent cadastral parcels in a region, or no point belonging to the vector layer that represents individual trees can not be contained in any polygon of the vector layer that represents buildings within a region. 

GIS software offers functionalities allowing the user to define relevant topology rules, as well as algorithms to check if they apply and to clean the vector layer where inconsistencies are identified. 

Geoprocessing is a general term used to define any operation - process - applied to a geographical dataset, with the scope of obtaining a derived dataset opening new insights on the data. Common geoprocessing operations are geographic feature overlay, feature selection and analysis, topology processing and data conversion. Geoprocessing allows one to define, manage, and analyze geographic information to support decision making. 


![elements of a geoprocessing operation](media/fig84.png "elements of a geoprocessing operation")

Figure 8.4 - elements of a geoprocessing operation

**TIP**: You can access Processing Algorithms (such as those used in this module) on the **Processing Toolbox** or **Locator Bar**.


## Main content: 

### Phase 1: Understanding your data.

There are many geoprocessing operations that can be performed on vector data, most commonly including geographic feature overlay, feature selection and analysis, topology processing and data conversion. In this first phase, we will become familiar with some of them, understanding how they work and what results we can expect. 


#### **Step 1. Prepare your working environment.**

Open QGIS, set up the coordinate reference system you will work in - EPSG 3123 -  and add the following data layers:

* Polygons - administrative boundaries; buildings; land use;
* Lines - roads, rivers;
* Points - places of worship, places of interest

At this point, your QGIS map window should look like in figure 8.5, of course, most probably, in other colours. 


**TIP**: Use spatial indices to speed up and improve processing time. You can do this using the **Create spatial index** algorithm.

![Loaded vector data sets: points, line and polygons](media/fig85.png "Loaded vector data sets: points, line and polygons")

Figure 8.5 - Loaded vector data sets: points, line and polygons

**Check!** All layers are in the same coordinate system (EPSG 3123) by looking in the right down side corner. If it is so, then you are looking at 7 vector data layers overlaid. 

#### **Step 2. Understand what you are looking at.** 

At this point, we have 7 vector layers loaded into our QGIS project. The next steps will help us understand our data. 

* Check how many features we have in a layer - there are several ways to do that: 

    * **Double click on the layer of interest ‣ Properties ‣ Information ‣ Feature count**
    * **Open the attribute table of the layer of interest and look at the upper central side** 


Before running any basic statistics, let us complete the attribute table with some geometric attributes (see Module 6 for details): 

* Roads layer - calculate length for each road segment and store it in the attribute table: output field name - length `round($length, 2)`
* Buildings layer - calculate the area for each building and store it in the attribute table; output field name - area `round($area, 2)`

Now, the attribute fields are filled, yet if you are not certain in which measurement unit QGIS has calculated the length of roads segments and areas of buildings, then checking the coordinate system information will help you. 

Click on the down right corner of the QGIS map window, on EPSG 3123 and a window as the one in figure 8.6 will appear. 


![Specifications of the coordinate reference system used in the QGIS project](media/fig86.png "Specifications of the coordinate reference system used in the QGIS project")

Figure 8.6 - Specifications of the coordinate reference system used in the QGIS project

Thus, we find out that the measurement unit is the meter, therefore the lengths are measured in meters and the areas in square meters. 

* Run basic statistics on the loaded layers to get a better grip on your data (figure 8.7 ):

    * **Vector menu ‣ Analysis Tools ‣ Basic statistics for fields**
    * **Processing toolbox window ‣ search for 'stats'**


![Basics statistics for fields](media/fig87.png "Basics statistics for fields")

Figure 8.7 - Basics statistics for fields

The statistics returned depend on the field type we choose and are generated as an HTML file.

Let’s run it on our roads layer and see what results we get. Complete the window, like in figure 8.8. 


![Preparing to run basics statistics for roads layer](media/fig88.png "Preparing to run basics statistics for roads layer")

Figure 8.8 - Preparing to run basics statistics for roads layer

The output file is an html which can be opened with any browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari etc. ) that should look like below: 


```
Analyzed field: length
Count: 64473
Unique values: 33106
NULL (missing) values: 0
Minimum value: 0.04
Maximum value: 19690.45
Range: 19690.41
Sum: 13927358.250000086
Mean value: 216.01846121632445
Median value: 111.18
Standard deviation: 372.48583667812585
Coefficient of Variation: 1.724324090546652
Minority (rarest occurring value): 0.04
Majority (most frequently occurring value): 0.55
First quartile: 51.03
Third quartile: 239.99
Interquartile Range (IQR): 188.96
```


From these basic statistics, we find out that there are 64473 road segments in the loaded layer, where the shortest has 0.04m and the longest 19690.45m - almost 20 km. We find out that the sum of roads in Lagos is almost 14k km (13927.358 km). Given that the mean is greater than the median, it tells us that the 2nd half of the dataset contains longer road segments and that it outweighs the road segments in the 1st half. However, the median shows that most road segments have length around 500 m. 

Running the basic statistics on the layer Buildings for the type category, we obtain the followings: 


```
Analyzed field: type
Count: 827657
Unique values: 74
NULL (missing) values: 773210
Minimum value: Brgy. San Vicente
Maximum value: yes;house
Minimum length: 0
Maximum length: 20
Mean length: 0.3669563599413767
```


The results don’t look the same, we don’t have mean, nor median or standard deviation. That is because the attribute field we ran the algorithm on is different, we don’t have numbers but words - types of buildings. We find out that out of 827657 buildings in Lagos, for 773210 we don’t know the type of the building. We also find out that there are 74 unique categories. 


#### **Step 3. Basic checks to quickly find errors in your data.**

Perfect, flawless datasets are the equivalent of the ideal gas in physics. There is no such thing, but many can come very close to it. Therefore, before doing any kind of analysis to extract information, at least some basic checks are necessary on how _clean_ the data we have are. 

There are many types of errors that can affect the quality of your data and, given the scope of your geospatial analysis, their influence on the final result can be more or less important. For example, if you use geospatial data to route yourself from point A to point B by car, then having a roads layer complete with attributes on which streets are one way or  closed to road traffic, is essential to get a viable result.  However, if your routing is by foot, then that information is not crucial for your result. 

When referring to geospatial data errors, there are 2 main terms that need to be well understood: 

**Accuracy** is the degree to which information on a map matches real-world values and it applies both to the geometry and to attributes.

**Precision** refers to the level of measurement and exactness of description in a geospatial dataset.

**An error** encompasses both the imprecision of data and its inaccuracies. **Data quality **refers to the level of precision and accuracy of the datasets and it is most often documented in data quality reports. 

Analysing and _cleaning _a geospatial dataset can be a very time consuming and cumbersome task, however - as shown in the example above - it is essential. In this section, we present a few GIS functionalities that allow a user to perform fast checks on vector data and draw a set of preliminary conclusions on its quality. 

**Topology checks.**

QGIS offers a core functionality that allows the user to perform a series of topological checks on the loaded vector datasets, named Topology Checker. The Topology Checker is a Core plugin and can be activated from the **Manage and Install Plugins Dialog**. Open the Manage and Install Plugins Dialog and make sure that the Topology Checker plugin is activated (with check sign). It can be found under the **Installed** tab.

![Topology checker plugin](media/fig89_a.png "Topology checker plugin")

Figure 8.9.a - Topology checker plugin

To show the Topology Checker, enable it as a panel under **View ‣ Panels ‣ Topology Checker** (figure 8.9.b). If it does not appear in the Panels menu, you can enable it by clicking the Topology Checker button ![Topology checker button](media/fig89_btn.png "Topology checker button") on the Plugins toolbar. Once activated it’s window looks like in figure 8.9.c.

Figure 8.9.b - Topology checker panel


![Topology checker window](media/fig89_c.png "Topology checker window")

Figure 8.9.c - Topology checker window


To define the topology rules, click on the third icon ![Topology rule settings button](media/fig810_btn.png "Topology rule settings button"), opening a window as in figure 8.10. 


![Topology rule settings window](media/fig810.png "Topology rule settings window")

Figure 8.10 - Topology rule settings window


We will set a number of rules for the layers we have loaded in our QGIS project, considering the real world objects they depict- roads, buildings, waterways in Lagos. 

The configuration of the topology is straightforward, as the rules that can be applied based on the selected layer are already embedded in this functionality, as figure 8.11 depicts. 


![Topology rules dropdown menu based on the selected layer](media/fig811.png "Topology rules dropdown menu based on the selected layer")

Figure 8.11 - Topology rules dropdown menu based on the selected layer.

Choose the topology rules as depicted in figure 8.12. 


![Topology rules to be set](media/fig812.png "Topology rules to be set")

Figure 8.12 - Topology rules to be set 

Click on the first icon ![Validate rules button](media/fig813_btn.png "Validate rules button") on the Topology Checker window to run and wait for the results. After running the topology check, your map windows should look like in figure 8.13. 


![Topology check results](media/fig813.png "Topology check results")

Figure 8.13 - Topology check results

In the down right side corner, the topology checker window lists all errors identified based on the rules we have defined in the earlier phase. If the Show errors checkbox is ticked, then the errors will be highlighted on the map with red. Double clicking on a selected error, will move the map to its location. 

The process of correcting the errors in a dataset, be it geometry related (duplicates, gaps etc.) or in the attribute related  (missing values, misspelled etc.) is called cleaning a dataset and it is most times as cumbersome as it is necessary. Although there are functionalities to support a semi-automatically cleaning process, the user’s input is often necessary. For example, in figure 8.14, we have zoomed in an error in our points of interest layer, a duplicated point. As it can be seen, there are 2 point depicting one cafe, the difference being in the attribute table where one is listed as a cafe and one as a “doityourself” - which one can assume might be a popular name for cafes where you prepare your own coffee. 


![Duplicate point error in points of interest vector layer](media/fig814.png "sDuplicate point error in points of interest vector layer")

Figure 8.14 - Duplicate point error in points of interest vector layer

In this particular case, the decision of the user would most probably be to remove the duplicate point, as it can insert error in further spatial analysis. For example, if a town official wants to know how many restaurants and cafes are in a specific neighbourhood, the duplicate point will insert an error in the results and that could eventually lead to mislead decisions.  

Therefore, we will proceed with an automatic removal of the duplicate points. To do it, we will use a core functionality of QGIS - **Delete duplicate geometries** - found in the processing toolbox. Your QGIS should look as in figure 8.15. 


![ Delete duplicate geometries on layer points of interest](media/fig815.png " Delete duplicate geometries on layer points of interest")

Figure 8.15 - Delete duplicate geometries on layer points of interest

After running the algorithm, the functionality window presents the results, it has identified 6 duplicate points, just as the topology checker, and it informs the user that it has deleted them all, leaving the points of interest layer with **2727 features**. Rename this layer to **pois_cleaned**. Note that the output is a layer in memory, you can make it permanent by saving it to a file.


![Result of running delete duplicate geometries](media/fig816.png "Result of running delete duplicate geometries")

Figure 8.16 - Result of running delete duplicate geometries

Re-running the topology checker will lead to a 0 errors results with respect to the topology rule of no geometric duplicates for the points of interest layer. 

**Attention!** The algorithm considers **only geometries**, ignoring the attribute. If, such is our case, there are some differences in the attribute for the duplicates, the user has no control over which one will be kept. Therefore, if there is a need for all information to be kept, it must be first copied to all geometries, so when a duplicate feature is deleted there is no info loss. 

Let us run another topology check, this time on our building layer. Configure the following rules: 

* No duplicate
* No invalid geometries

![Topology check on the buildings vector layer](media/fig817_a.png "Topology check on the buildings vector layer")

Figure 8.17a - Topology checker rules on the buildings vector layer

Run the algorithm. 

The result should look like figure 8.17b. 


![Results of topology check on the buildings vector layer](media/fig817_b.png "Results of topology check on the buildings vector layer")

Figure 8.17b - Results of topology check on the buildings vector layer

Clean the duplicate feature by using the process indicated above (figure 8.18a)

![Results of Delete duplicate geometries](media/fig818_c.png "Results of Delete duplicate geometries")

Figure 8.18b - Results of removing duplicate geometries on the buildings vector layer


A complete cleaning of the vector datasets used for this module is out of scope. Its complexity transforms it in a more advanced module in itself.


#### **Step 4. Take a closer look at the information attached to the points, lines and polygons.**

Let's run one more algorithm to get a sense of what the attributes for our Lagos layers are. After we’ve identified how many features each layer has, let’s see how many and which are the unique attributes in the following cases: 

* layer buildings_cleaned - attribute type;
* layer pois_cleaned - attribute fclass;
* layer waterways - attribute fclass;
* layer pofw - attribute fclass;
* layer roads -attribute fclass;
* layer landuse - attribute fclass;

For that, go to **Vector ‣ Analysis Tools ‣ List unique values** (figure 8.19)


![List unique values in a vector layer functionality](media/fig819_a.png "List unique values in a vector layer functionality")

Figure 8.19a - List unique values in a vector layer functionality

In the window that opens, insert each layer's name and attribute of interest as enumerated in the list above and you should have the following results:

Table 8.1 - Table identifying how many and what are the unique values for the selected attributes

For a more in depth analysis of the attributes of our vector layers, we will use the GroupStats plugin. It was developed to support statistics calculation for feature groups in a vector layer making it very useful to gain more understanding of your data, as well as to spot potential errors in the attributes. 

First, make sure that you have installed and activated the GroupStats plugin. Afterwards, to open the GroupStats window, go to   **Vector ‣ GroupStats ‣ GroupStats**.

![GroupStats plugin](media/fig820_a.png "GroupStats plugin")

Figure 8.20a - GroupStats plugin

A new window like the one in figure 8.20b should open. 


![GroupStats window](media/fig820_b.png "GroupStats window")

Figure 8.20b - GroupStats window

As per the analysis done earlier, we have seen that for the layer buildings we have 74 different types of buildings, but how many each and what is the total built area taken by each category? How much space for schools, for markets, houses? GroupStats can help us answer this question. On the right side of the window, there is the control panel, where we choose what we want to calculate, as well as how the data should be arranged. Using drag&drop, follow the arrangement in figure 8.21, then press calculate. 


![Running GroupStats on the building layer](media/fig821.png "Running GroupStats on the building layer")

Figure 8.21 - Running GroupStats on the building layer. 

Looking at the result, we can extract important insights regarding our data. For example, for residential purposes in Lagos state, we have 3270 buildings with a total surface area built of 405937 square meters, approx. 40 hectares. We also find out that the largest has 1474 square meters as the smallest has 10 square meters. And one can continue the analysis for further valuable information.
