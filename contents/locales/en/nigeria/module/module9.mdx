## Thematic introduction

## Breakdown of the concepts

### The raster data model

A raster is a regular matrix of values, as in figure 9.1.


![A matrix of values](media/fig91.png "A matrix of values")

Figure 9.1 - A matrix of values

Values can be assigned either to** grid points**, mostly to the centroids, and in this case the raster can be referred to as a lattice. The second option is for the values to be assigned to the whole of the **grid cell **- called pixels (see figure 9.2). For the first case, the raster usually represents a continuous field, such as elevation, temperature, precipitations, chemical concentrations etc. For the second case, when the values are assigned to the entire area of the pixel, the raster usually represents an image - a satellite image, a scanned map, converted vector maps (see Phase 2). It must be noted that this data model is not particularly efficient for networks and other types of data heavily dependent on lines, such as property boundaries. 


![On the left side, the values are assigned to centroids. On the right, values are assigned to the grid cell area - the pixel.](media/fig92.png "On the left side, the values are assigned to centroids. On the right, values are assigned to the grid cell area - the pixel.")

Figure 9.2 - On the left side, the values are assigned to centroids. 

On the right, values are assigned to the grid cell area - the pixel. 				


### Rational of raster processing

As in the case of vector data processing, the rationale behind the raster data processing is based on the very same capacity of the geographical information systems to store, process  and represent information of the real world phenomena, just that the way in which this is accomplished differs. Instead of having distinct points, lines and polygons stored as collections of x and y coordinates, we have a matrix of values that drapes over a specific area like a mesh. To have a clearer picture in mind, imagine the temperature maps shown on TV. Temperature is a continuous field, there are no places on the surface of the Earth without temperature, be it positive, negative or 0.

Many operations can be performed on raster datasets, the concept of geoprocessing detailed in module 8 applies here as well. The term used to encompass the operations that can be performed on rasters is _map algebra_. 

**Map algebra** represents a set of primitive operations[^1] in a GIS which allows two or more raster layers of _similar dimensions_ to produce a new raster layer (map) using various operations such as addition, subtraction, comparison etc.  

There are four categories of operations that can be performed on rasters, as follows: 

*   Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
*   Statistical operations: minimum, maximum, average, median.
*   Relational operations provide comparisons between cells using functions such as greater than, smaller than or equal to.
*   Trigonometric operations: sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine between two or more raster datasets.
*   Exponential and logarithmic operations use exponent and logarithm functions.

For each of these operations, there are algorithms implemented in most GIS environments that allow a user to apply them on her data. In the following, we will also implement some of the most common operations to get a sense of how to work with and what should one expect from this kind of data processing. 

The concept of _similar dimensions_ refers to the characteristics of the raster datasets. That is, the operations detailed above can not be performed with meaningful results on 2 raster datasets with different spatial, temporal or spectral resolutions. In the following, we will very shortly introduce all four resolutions that are relevant for raster imagery.

Remembering what are the 4 types of resolutions of a satellite imagery (raster with values assigned to cell area - pixels): 

1. **Spatial resolution** corresponds to the elementary size of the ground surface measured, it is expressed in units of length and it represents the length of a pixel side (see figure 9.3). For example, as you’ve seen in module 3, the High Resolution Settlement Layer Data has a spatial resolution of 30 meters, i.e. each pixel of the dataset estimates the number of people living within a 30-meter. 

2. **Temporal resolution** is associated with overhead imagery (images acquired by satellites, planes, helicopters, drones) and it corresponds to the period between 2 consecutive images of the exact same point on Earth, taken in the same conditions (as much as possible), such as the same aircraft, same altitude etc. For example, Landsat 8 has a temporal resolution of 16 days, i.e. each point on Earth is revisited by the Landsat 8 satellite each 16 days[^2]. 

3. **Spectral resolution** - the sensors onboard of satellites or airplanes capture electromagnetic radiance coming from all objects on Earth - water, settlements, forests, roads, buildings, bare land etc. - and the sensors are specifically built to capture it at a given known spectral band (or wavelength). The human eye can see a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum - the visible light (red, green and blue), but sensors can ‘see’ much more! (see figure 9.4)


![Electromagnetic spectrum (photo credit [NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro))](media/fig94.png "Electromagnetic spectrum (photo credit [NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro))")

Figure 9.4 - Electromagnetic spectrum (photo credit NASA Science - [https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro))

4. **Radiometric resolution** is determined by the number of bits into which the recorded radiation is divided. In 8-bit data, the digital numbers (DN) can range from 0 to 255 for each pixel (28 ¼ 256 total possible numbers). Clearly, more bits means that the sensor can detect more subtle changes in the energy it captures, that leads to a ‘clearer’ image, a  higher radiometric accuracy of the sensor but also requires more space to store the data. 

**Spectral bands**

A raster dataset contains one or more layers called bands. Each band stores another set of information on the area the raster covers. Each band has the exact same extent and coordinates, but not necessarily the same spatial resolution. Also, aside from the values stored, there are other key properties contained, such as: maximum, minimum and mean cell values and _histogram_ of cell values. 

A **histogram** is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data (see figure 9.5), in other ways is a manner in which one can get a sense of the data at hand.


![Example of a histogram, where x is a raster layer](media/fig95.png "Example of a histogram, where x is a raster layer")

Figure 9.5 - Example of a histogram, where x is a raster layer

Why is this important in our context? Because, as mentioned at the beginning, a raster is a matrix of continuous numerical values (remember the temperature example) and a histogram helps the user understand how the values of his rasters are distributed. Each bar groups the cell values that fall in a specific range, higher the bar more cells have values in that specific range. In case, the raster has more than one band, then the histogram will be computed for each one. There are no gaps between the ranges depicted on a histogram, the histogram is used only for continuous data.  


## Main content 

### Phase 1: Understanding your raster data.

In the last two decades, the number of satellites capturing data from Earth has grown exponentially. Furthermore, an open data access policy that has been adopted by different space agencies, such as NASA for the [Landsat program](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-data-access?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con) or the European Space Agency for the [Copernicus program](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data), has opened the door for an overwhelming stream of Earth Observation data. As a natural consequence, the scientific progress of algorithms, methodologies and the development of more powerful tools to process raster data - especially satellite imagery - has been impressive and extensive in fields such as agriculture, forestry, urban development, humanitarian activities, ocean and sea water monitoring, security and so many more. In the following 3 phases, we will introduce some of the most common processing techniques and what results to expect from them. 


#### **Step 1. Prepare your working environment.** 

We will strat by adding to your QGIS project all the raster datasets that we will be working with, as follows: 

*   High Resolution Settlement Layer Data 
*   Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
*   Moderate Dynamic Land Cover: the 5 available epochs 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. 

As the High Resolution Settlement Layer Data has been presented in a previous module, we will also detail information on the other 2 dataset we will employ in this module. 

1. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a global digital surface model (DSM) dataset with a horizontal resolution of approximately 30 meters (1 arcsec mesh). A DSM includes ground surface, vegetation and man-made objects, such as buildings, bridges etc. as opposed to the digital terrain model (DTM) that considered strictly the terrain. 

2. Dynamic Land Cover Map is a  Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) product derived from the PROBA-V 100 m time-series and several other land cover datasets.  The product provides primary land cover discrete classes, as well as continuous field layers for all basic land cover classes that provide proportional estimates for vegetation/ground cover for the land cover types. The product has 3 bands: discrete_classification, forest_type and urban_coverfraction. The following 2 tables present the values for each discrete class:

To organize your layers better, group them by category, as follows: for the land cover 5 raster layers, make one group named Land Cover (in the Layers Panel, click on the Add Group button ![Add Group Button](media/add-group-btn.png "Add Group Button")). For the digital surface model, make one group named SRTM DEM. 

Don’t forget to also add the boundary of the working area, Lagos state, which is a vector dataset. 

Your QGIS map window should look like in figure 9.6, maybe in slightly different colors. 


![Loaded raster datasets](media/fig96.png "Loaded raster datasets")

Figure 9.6 - Loaded raster datasets


#### **Step 2. Understand what you are looking at.** 

Next, we will use a series of tools that will allow us to get a sense of the data we are working with. 

After loading all the datasets, we will check the coordinate reference system in which all our datasets are in.  As we know from previous modules, QGIS offers the possibility to reproject all datasets loaded into the project on the fly, however that could lead to geoprocessing issues along the way. Thus, even if all layers are correctly overlaid, as can one say by visual inspection, we will proceed in reprojecting them all in the official coordinate system of our region of interest, Lagos state - EPSG: 3123. 

There are several ways to get information on the loaded layers in QGIS, some providing the user with more details than others. For a quick overview of a dataset’s metadata, **double-click the layer and open Properties ‣ Information**.

For layer HRSL_Lagos_Population, the information window would look like in figure 9.7. 


![Extracting basic metadata from a raster layer](media/fig97.png "Extracting basic metadata from a raster layer")

Figure 9.7 - Extracting basic metadata from a raster layer

With regard to our first question on what CRS is being used for the datasets we have loaded, we can observe that even if the HRSL is correctly overlaid, the dataset native’s projection is EPSG 4326 - WGS 84 - Geographic, with units measured in degrees. We also identify that this specific raster layer has only one band, yet the pixel size is difficult to read as the measurement is in degrees and not meters, which would make it easier to understand. 

Thus, the first thing to do is to reproject all datasets we will work with in the same coordinate system - EPSG 26392.

Starting with the HRSL datasets, we go to **Raster ‣ Projections ‣ Warp (Reproject)** (see figure 9.8).


![Reproject functionality in QGIS](media/fig98.png "Reproject functionality in QGIS")

Figure 9.8 - Reproject functionality in QGIS

After selecting the Warp functionality, a new window will appear allowing the user to set the correct parameters (see figure 9.9a). 


![Warp (reproject) QGIS window](media/fig99_a.png "Warp (reproject) QGIS window")

Figure 9.9a - Warp (reproject) QGIS window

If you selected the output to be **[Save to temporary file]** then there will be a raster layer named `Reprojected` in the Layers Panel. This is a memory layer and you can rename this layer to Reprojected_HRSL_Lagos_Population and save it to make it persistent.


![Reprojected HRSL](media/fig99_b.png "Reprojected HRSL")

Figure 9.9b - Reprojected HRSL

You will notice that unlike when you reprojected vector datasets, there is a new parameter that you can set “Resampling method to use”. 

**Resampling** represents the interpolation of the cell values so that it transforms the raster as indicated by the user. There are multiple resampling methods available within the warp functionality, each with its own mathematical support. Yet, detailed explanations on each one is not the scope of this exercise. Further reading is available at references. 

In this particular case, we want to reproject population data - numerical values and based on the selected resampling method (nearest neighbour),  the coordinate of each output pixel will be used to calculate a new value from close-by pixel values in the input layer (see figure 9.10). 


![Resample method - nearest neighbour](media/fig910.png "Resample method - nearest neighbour")

Figure 9.10 - Resample method - nearest neighbour (photo credit: ILWIS documentation - [(http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm](http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm))

Input pixels are represented by dashed black lines, coordinates of input pixels by black dots; output pixels are represented by red solid lines, coordinates of output pixels by red plus signs. The grey arrows indicate how output values are determined. It can be seen in figure 9.10, some values of the input map may be used twice in the output map, while other input values may not be used at all. That is why, although one of the fastest methods to resample,  it is not appropriate in our case, as we are working with numerical data - population data. This resampling method is suitable for categorical data - such as land cover values. 

To reproject our population raster dataset, we will use the bilinear interpolation method to resample the pixel values (see figure 9.11).


![Resample method - bilinear](media/fig911.png "Resample method - bilinear")

Figure 9.11 - Resample method - bilinear (photo credit: ILWIS documentation - [(http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm](http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm))

The bilinear method determines the new value of a cell based on a weighted distance average of the four nearest input cell centers. It is useful for continuous data and will cause some smoothing of the data. 

We proceed in checking the CRS of the 5 land cover datasets that we have loaded into our QGIS project. Accessing **Layer properties ‣ information**, we can see that all 5 land cover layers are projected in EPSG:3857 - WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator. One solution would be to use the Reproject tool and configure for each layer individually. Yet, a faster way is to use the reproject functionality running as a **batch process**.

**Batch processing** is the ability of running repetitive processes on data, with minimum user interaction. Most QGIS functionalities have this option available and it can be activated in the process window by clicking the **Run Batch Process** button ![Run batch processe button](media/batch-btn.png "Run batch processe button") and switching to the Run batch process tab (see figure 9.12). 


![Batch processing tab on a QGIS functionality window](media/fig912.png "Batch processing tab on a QGIS functionality window")

Figure 9.12 - Batch processing tab on a QGIS functionality window


For the 5 land cover raster layers, we will use the batch processing and as resample method nearest neighbour. To add a new layer, click on the + pictogram. To automatically fill the CRS and resampling method parameters, click on autofill button on top of the corresponding columns and select `Fill down`. Rename the reprojected rasters by adding the EPSG code at the end of the name, for example LandCover2015, will become landCover2015_3123. Set your parameters as in figure 9.13: source CRS: EPSG: 3857, target CRS EPSG 3123, resampling method to use: nearest neighbour (we explained in the paragraph above why), nodata value for output bands: 255 (from the information window, we see the data type - yte - 8bit unsigned integer - which means that the maximum value can be 255), output resolution:100 m (as the initial land cover rasters). After setting all parameters, check the box in the left corner of the window - **Load layers on completion** and click **Run**.

Figure 9.13c - Reprojected land cover rasters

Next comes the digital surface model rasters. As one can observe, to cover our region of interest, we needed several _raster tiles_. When raster files become too large - imagine one single DSM file at 30 m for Europe which has over 10 million square kilometers - they are splitted into **tiles **because, in smaller areas, they are more easily manageable. 

Although we could use the wrap tool in batch mode to reproject all the DSM raster files, at a visual inspection, one can also notice that the delimitations between each tile is fairly visible, making it, at least, visually unattractive. What would be useful is to have a complete overview of the terrain, as a continuous phenomena - as it is, in fact - without artificial disruptions. To obtain that, we will use the GDAL merge tool, available in the Processing toolbar to merge all DSM rasters together. To open it, go to **Processing ‣ Toolbox** and in the search bar write **Merge** (see figure 9.14). Alternatively, you can search for Merge in the Locator Bar.


![Finding the GDAL merge tool in the Processing Toolbox](media/fig914.png "Finding the GDAL merge tool in the Processing Toolbox")

Figure 9.14 - Finding the GDAL merge tool in the Processing Toolbox 

In the merge window that opens, select the DSM raster files that we want to mosaic and click run. The result should look like in figure 9.15c.

Figure 9.15c - Mosaic of all DSM files corresponding to our work region


Now, we can proceed to reprojecting the mosaic - one file, instead of 6 files. Go to **Raster ‣ projection ‣ Wrap (reproject)** and set the known parameters: 

   * Source CRS EPSG 4326
   * Target CRS: EPSG:26392 
   * Resampling method: Nearest neighbour
   * Output file resolution - 30 m. 

At his point, we should have all layers in the same CRS - EPSG 26392.

We can do another check to make sure that all rasters we are working with are projected as well as getting any additional information on the data by running a batch process of Raster Information on all. To open the functionality window, go to **Raster ‣ Miscellaneous ‣ Raster Information**. Your batch processing raster information window should look as in figure 9.16.

After preparing the rasters by reprojecting them into the CRS we are working with and reading their metadata to better understand the files, it is time to delve in the actual data. To achieve that, we will calculate and interpret the histograms (see Breakdown of concepts section for details) of our rasters. 

To calculate a histogram, select the raster layer you are interested in, open by double clicking the `Properties` dialog window and go to `Histogram` (see figure 9.17). 


![Histogram window](media/fig917.png "Histogram window")

Figure 9.17 - Histogram window

Hit the `Compute histogram` button and QIS quill automatically compute it. 

After computing the histogram, we can see that the mouse turns into a loupe. It is a tool that allows inspection of the histogram, seeing how the frequency of different value ranges. Zooming in and you can see something like in figure 9.18. 

To go back to full view, click left.

Figure 9.18 - Zooming in on the DSM_mosaic_26392 computed histogram

More than just seeing the distribution of the numerical values of the pixels, the histogram allows the user to reclassify the values for visualisation of the raster. To do that use the 2 tools to pinpoint on the histogram the new min and max values (see figure 9.19). 


![Selecting min and max values to reclassify the raster](media/fig919.png "Selecting min and max values to reclassify the raster")

Figure 9.19 - Selecting min and max values to reclassify the raster

After pressing apply, the raster will be represented using the new selected min-max range. This functionality allows the user to ignore extreme values that can stretch ab-normally the raster. 

Even though the next tool we use is a plugin (see module 1 for plugin details), we consider it very useful in starting working with raster. We are referring to the **Value Tool** that allows immediate identification of cell values by hovering over raster layers. 

Go to **Plugin ‣ Manage and Install Plugins** and search for the **Value Tool** plugin and click install. Afterwards, right click on the QGIS main window bar to open all available Panels and Toolbars in your QGIS installation and select the **Value Tool panel**. Check your QGIS interface to see where it opened.

Figure 9.20 - The Value Tool Panel

The practicality of this tool resides in its simplicity of use, with just a few clicks, one can very easily extract value cells in the exact areas of interest. Furthermore, it allows this for all loaded raster layers. 

The Value Tool has 3 tabs: Table, Graph, Options (see figure 9.21).


![Loaded value tool - highlight on first tab - Table](media/fig921.png "Loaded value tool - highlight on first tab - Table")

Figure 9.21 - Loaded value tool - highlight on first tab - Table

The first tab - Table - presents a list of all loaded raster layers and the values of cells, as the user moves the mouse. There is also the possibility of selecting with how many decimals the values should be displayed. If the mouse is hovered outside a raster layer extent, instead of a value, a message will be displayed: “out of extent”. 

The second tab - Graph - displays in a united graph all values it reads at the position of the mouse. It allows the user to insert values for min and max on the Y axis - that is the axis of cell values. The X axis lists all bands of the raster it displays in the tabel, with the corresponding order numbers: the band that has number 1 in first tab, will also be number 1 in the graph. 

The third tab allows the user to customize what the `Value Tool` displays: what layers (all, only the visible ones or the selected ones) and which bands to show.
