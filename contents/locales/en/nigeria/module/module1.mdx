# Module 1 - Introduction to QGIS

**Author**: Ben Hur

## Pedagogical Introduction

This module serves as an introduction to QGIS. At the end of this module, learners should be familiar with:

*   what QGIS is
*   QGIS interface
*   QGIS settings
*   QGIS plugins

They should also learn:

*   how to install and open QGIS
*   the different parts and features of the QGIS interface
*   how to edit the interface layout and theme
*   the different QGIS settings, how to change them, and how they affect QGIS
*   what user profiles are and how use them
*   what plugins are and how to install them

The module will also discuss some nuances of QGIS and what makes it unique or different from other GIS such as QGIS file formats.


## Required tools and resources

The required tools and resources for this module are:

*   working computer
*   internet connection
*   QGIS 3.16 installed in the computer ([https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html))


## Prerequisites

*   basic knowledge of operating a computer

## Additional resources

* QGIS User Guide - [https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/)
* QGIS Training Manual - [https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/index.html](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)


## Thematic introduction

The map below ([https://flic.kr/p/2jFfGJP](https://flic.kr/p/2jFfGJP)) shows parts of the City of Bogota in Columbia made in the style of Vincent van Gogh’s “Starry Starry Night” by Andrés Felipe Lancheros Sánchez.

This next map ([https://flic.kr/p/2jAsphv](https://flic.kr/p/2jAsphv)) shows storm trace data from NOAA between 1851 to 2020 made by Fajr Alim.

This next one ([https://flic.kr/p/FA9TiR](https://flic.kr/p/FA9TiR)) is a map of Kerguelen Island by Heinrich Lingnau Schneider.

This last one ([https://flic.kr/p/2kqVzsg](https://flic.kr/p/v2kqVzsg)) is of field goal attempts and points scored per attempt during the UAAP Men’s Basketball Tournament Season 81 in the Philippines by Ben Hur Pintor.

What do all these maps have in common? For one, they were all made using QGIS.


## Breakdown of the concepts

The maps shown above were all created in QGIS ([https://qgis.org/en/site/](https://qgis.org/en/site/)), a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS). QGIS can be used with all kinds of spatial data (such as basketball data in the last example) and not just with earth-related geospatial data. 

People are able to create wonderful and amazing maps such as the examples above because QGIS is free, open source, and has powerful data management, analysis, and presentation capabilities.


## Main content

### Phase 1 title: Introduction to QGIS and the QGIS Interface

#### **What is QGIS**

**QGIS**, known as Quantum GIS prior to its 2.X release, is a mature, cross-platform, free and open source Geospatial Information System (GIS).

It is an enterprise ready GIS that has features for collecting, storing, analysing, presenting, and managing spatial & non-spatial data. It also integrates well with other existing geospatial technologies and serves as an integral part of any FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) stack.

Being cross-platform, QGIS runs on GNU/Linux, macOS, Windows, and even Android.


#### **Release cycle and versions**

QGIS releases and development follow a time based schedule/roadmap ([https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html)).

A QGIS release is specified by three numbers (X.Y.Z). For example, QGIS 3.16.4.

*   X refers to the main version. In this case, QGIS 3.
*   Y refers to the release version. In this case release version 16. Release versions are always even numbers since odd numbers are reserved for development versions.
*   Z refers to the Point Release (PR) of that version. For 3.16.4, that means it is the 4th point release of the 3.16 version.

There are three main branches of QGIS that users can install. These are the **Long Term Release (LTR)** branch, **Latest Release (LR)** branch, and the **Development (Nightly)** branch.

*   **Long Term Release (LTR)** is named that way because it is maintained and receives bug fixes until the next LTR is released. Currently, that means one (1) year. As of February 2021, the current LTR is 3.16.4. This is scheduled to be replaced by QGIS 3.22.4 in February 2022.
*   **Latest Release (LR) **refers to the release version of QGIS that contains the most recent or latest features. A new LR is released every four (4) months. For example, a new 3.18 LR was released this February 2021. The next LR (3.20) will be released 4 months from now which is in June 2021. Currently, every 3rd LR becomes the next LTR. For example, the LTR this February 2021 is the 3.16 release. The 3rd LR from 3.16 is 3.22  therefore the next LTR will be based on the 3.22 release version. 
*   **Development/Nightly **is based on the most recent version of the QGIS source code but is useful if you want to test, debug, or help in the development of QGIS.

So which version should you use? It depends. If you need a version that is maintained for a longer time and you don’t necessarily need new features as they are released then the LTR version might be for you. If you need to have the most recent features and don’t mind doing an upgrade every few months, the LR version just might be for you. Sometimes it’s also good to take a look at the development or nightly versions especially if you are curious or excited about the upcoming features in QGIS.
