# Module 7 - Creating and Editing Layers

**Author**: Ketty, Ben Hur

## Pedagogical Introduction

This module is designed to teach you how to use QGIS tools to create a new GIS layer. You'll learn concepts like digitizing and georeferencing. In addition, you’ll learn the following concepts;

- Digitizing
- Georeferencing
- Working computer
- Internet access
- QGIS 3.16 or later
- [Topo Map of Bangladesh central region](data/nf-46-01.jpeg)

## Prerequisites

- A fair knowledge of all previous modules
- Basic knowledge of operating a computer

## Additional resources

- Creating Layers - [https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/create_layers.html](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/create_layers.html)
- Digitizing Forest Stands - [https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/forestry/stands_digitazing.html?highlight=digitizing](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/forestry/stands_digitazing.html?highlight=digitizing)

## Thematic introduction

Let’s start with an example:

Let’s imagine that your department is planning to build new hospitals for the region. They may want to conduct an environmental pre-assessment for the planned infrastructure project. The assessment may involve conducting research on available data. As you might imagine, there is a great deal of geographic data available in formats that can not be immediately integrated with other GIS data. Some of this data may be in the form of old maps, high resolution satellite imagery or remotely sensed imagery which is often used for making digital maps like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Creating and Editing is good for updating changes to your layers or database. This is where Creation and Editing of layers comes in. One way in which new data can be created in a GIS is through digitizing. Other methods include georeferencing, scanning and vectorization, clipping, selecting and then saving. It’s important to remember that the created data is dependent on the uniqueness of the original source. For example the image below shows that each image product will produce a unique dataset.

Figure 7.1: Remotely sensed images of different coastlines. A. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data (using microwaves to collect data for creating representative images), B. topographic and bathymetric lidar data (height and elevation data represented by colors), C. hyperspectral imagery (adding color to invisible energy), and D. digital photography (human eye visible colors represented as themselves)

## Breakdown of the concepts

Digitizing in GIS is the process of “tracing”, in a geographically correct way, information from media/maps. The process of georeferencing relies on the coordination of points on the scanned image (data to be georeferenced) with points on a geographically referenced data (data to which the image will be georeferenced). By “linking” points on the image with those same locations in the geographically referenced data you will create a transformation that converts the location of the entire image to the correct geographic location.
