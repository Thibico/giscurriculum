# Module 3 - OpenStreetMap and the High Resolution Settlement Layer

**Author**: Ben

## Pedagogical Introduction

This module will introduce OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL). At the end of this module, learners would be familiar with:

- OpenStreetMap principles
- OpenStreetMap data and use-cases
- High Resolution Settlement Layer data and use-cases

They should also be able to:

- load OSM data as vectors and tiles in QGIS
- load the HRSL raster in QGIS

## Required tools and resources

The required tools and resources for this module are:

- working computer
- internet connection
- QGIS 3.16 installed in the computer ([https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html))
- Rajshahi_division and Rajshahi_district vector layers (inside [module3.gpkg](module3.gpkg)).

## Prerequisites

- basic knowledge of operating a computer
- familiarity with spatial data formats, the QGIS interface, and how to load layers in QGIS (completion of Modules 0, 1, and 2)

## Thematic introduction

Maps have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. We can just pull up our phones and open applications that utilize maps and location data. There are apps that we use for orienting and locating ourselves, for navigating and getting from one place to another, maps are shown when we order food from our favorite delivery service, etc. Maps have become so integral to our day to day activities that we tend to forget that there are places in the world that are still unmapped or not found in the digital maps that we use.

## Breakdown of the concepts

The ubiquity of maps in our lives is a byproduct of the sheer amount of location and spatial data that we are collecting. The opportunities and potential for creating something good from the geospatial data available to us is outstanding but this will only be possible if these geospatial datasets are free and open.

### Phase 1 title: OpenStreetMap (OSM) data

#### **What is OpenStreetMap (OSM)?**

OpenStreetMap (OSM) ([https://www.openstreetmap.org/](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)) is a free, editable map of the whole world that is built by volunteers from across the globe and released with an open-content license. It is a project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world -- a map of the world by the people and for the people. If something is missing on OSM, you are free to add it. If something is wrong in OSM, you are free to correct it. OSM is a digital common good that greatly amplifies the value of the information added to it.
