# Module 10 - QGIS plugins

**Author**: Codrina Ilie

## Pedagogical Introduction

This module will highlight some of the most interesting and, hopefully useful, plugins that the QGIS international community has developed and made available for everyone to use. Given the topic of the module,

## and acquire the following skills:

- How to search and install a new plugin
- How to switch between the different plugins repositories
- How to read a plugin documentation and what to look for.
- Details on some of the most popular(?) plugins functionalities.

## Required Tools and Resources

- This module has been prepared using [QGIS version 3.16.1 - Hannover](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)

## Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of operating a computer
- A robust understanding of all modules, as the plugins we will present apply to various notions/elements that you’ve learned about as going through this curriculum, such as vectors, rasters, attribute tables, cartographic rules and many others.

## Main content

### Phase 1: Introduction to plugin mentality

One of the many advantages of the open source community - developers and users alike - is the incredible speed with which developments and improvements happen, the way in which new ideas spark and then get put into practice.

As you have seen in module 1, QGIS is designed with a ‘plugin’ architecture, allowing it to be easily customized for the user’ needs by adding external plugins. In fact, QGIS is the combination of the **core** and the **external plugins**. The core plugins - as the name suggests - form the main structure, they are maintained by the QGIS Development Team and they are always included in the installation, such as the Processing core plugin, the Zonal Statistics or the Plugin Manager. Over time, given their relevance, different external plugins migrated towards the core.

Of course, given the open source principles, coupled with the great and very detailed documentations available and the many communication channels and dedicated events, one can learn how to build a plugin that answers one’s requirements. And that is an **external plugin**. On the dedicated [web page](https://plugins.qgis.org/), you can find all the necessary documentation. Most external plugins are written in Python, but they can also be written in C++.

In this first phase, we will explore the QGIS plugin setup - how to search for a plugin to solve a specific requirement one might have, how to interpret its documentation and how to report to the developer if you’ve encountered a problem.

### The Plugin manager

QGIS offers a core plugin to allow users to manage, install, update and uninstall external plugins. The functionality is intuitive, providing full access to the official public plugin repository.

It must be highlighted that the external plugins - be they official or experimental - are the work of individual developers or organizations and the QGIS organization does not take any responsibility for them. That being said, there are some rules that the developers that want to share their work via the official repository, must comply with, as well as a series of recommendations for fast acceptance. Requirements include elements such as a compatible license, minimal documentation, clear identification of dependencies and others. The recommendations include checking if the plugin does not duplicate existing functionality, good shape of the source repository, compatible with all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and many others.

Experimental plugins - that are labelled as such in the plugin manager - are plugins that are in early stages of development, that are not suitable for operational use. They are regarded as “proof of concept” testing and users are not advised to install them unless they intend to use them for testing purposes.

Of course, in order to see the experimental plugins, the user must allow it, Thus in the Plugin manager settings, tick the option `Show also experimental plugins` (Figure 10.2a). There is also the possibility to list the deprecated plugins. These are not recommended because they are not maintained anymore.

The two types are well differentiated in Plugin Manager (see figures 10.1 and 10.2b).
